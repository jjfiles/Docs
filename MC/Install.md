4. If you get a warning about *Incompatible* mods. Dm me on discord and I'll help you get the right ones.

5. Once it's finished downloading all the mods. Double click the icon in Homestead icon in Prism to launch. The first launch can take quite a while, but if you don't get an error immediately it's probably working, just give it time.

## Game

### Joining

1. DM me with your Minecraft username. I'll add you to the Whitelist and give you the server address in return. Just enter the URL into the server address bar of a new multiplayer server.

### Settings / Tips

1. When you first spawn in, hit `V` on your keyboard to setup voice chat, if you are interested in doing that.

2. Open your inventory, in the top left select "Quests", or the book in your inventory. This should give you some directions to begin your journey with.

3. There is a lot to this pack. I highly suggesting reading through all the quest lists. Hit the arrow on the left sidebar when viewing a set of quests to select different quest sections. These are mostly seperated by mod or dimension.

4. You can set a home teleport location by typing `/sethome` in game. Then at any point you may type `/home` to be transported home instantly.
